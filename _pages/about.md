My name is Juliet and I'm a current senior at Duke University studying Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics. I work with [Timothy Dunn](https://www.tdunnlab.org/) on the applications of autoregressive hidden Markov models on Parkinsonian behavioral data. blah blah blah

Outside of STEM I enjoy dancing, baking, and exploring restaurants!
